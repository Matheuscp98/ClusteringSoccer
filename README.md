# ‚öΩ Clustering Soccer

## üìù Description

This **Pseudocode** ([**Pseudocode Clustering Soccer**](PseudocodeClusteringSoccer.md)) addresses the use of **K-Means Clustering in soccer** to group **players with similar performance characteristics**.

The code is designed in **Python** to extract data from [**Sofascore**](https://sofascore.com/) and [**Transfermarkt**](https://www.transfermarkt.com/), performing **clustering of soccer players** using the **unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithm K-Means**. It allows users to work with their **own datasets** of **athletes, referees, teams**, or any other preferred datasets. The **datasets used in the study** are also provided, containing data from the **five major European leagues** (**Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1**) for the **2022/2023 season**, as well as data from the **Brazilian league**.

The main goal is to enable users to execute the **process in Python** (or another programming language) across **all stages of the method**. The provided code does **not** focus on creating **visualizations** but rather on **applying the method**.
