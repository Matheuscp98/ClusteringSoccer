# ‚öΩ Clustering Soccer

## üìù Description

This Python code (with pseudocode provided in [PseudocodeClusteringSoccer.md](PseudocodeClusteringSoccer.md)) addresses the use of **K-Means Clustering in soccer** to group players with similar performance characteristics.

The code is designed in Python to extract data from [Sofascore](https://sofascore.com/) and [Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.com/), performing clustering of soccer players using the unsupervised machine learning algorithm K-Means. It allows users to work with their own datasets of athletes, referees, teams, or any other preferred datasets. The datasets used in the study are also provided, containing data from the five major European leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, and Ligue 1) for the 2022/2023 season, as well as data from the Brazilian league.

**Note:** The related paper is currently under review.

The main goal is to enable users to execute the process in Python (or another programming language) across all stages of the method. The provided code does not focus on creating visualizations but rather on applying the method.
