# Clustering Soccer

## Description

This Python code (with pseudocode provided in [PseudocodeClusteringSoccer.md](PseudocodeClusteringSoccer.md)) addresses the use of **K-Means Clustering in soccer** to group players with similar performance characteristics, as described in the paper:
- [Identifying Soccer Player Profiles Through Clustering: An Analysis of the Brazilian League Compared to the Big Five European Leagues](link).

The code is designed in Python to extract data from [Sofascore](https://sofascore.com/) and to perform clustering of soccer players using the unsupervised machine learning algorithm K-Means. It allows users to work with their own datasets of athletes, referees, teams, or any other preferred datasets. The dataset used in the paper is also provided, containing data from the five major leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, and Ligue 1) for the 2022/2023 season, as well as data from the Brazilian league.

The main goal is to enable users to execute the process in Python or another programming language across all stages of the method. The provided code does not focus on creating visualizations but rather on applying the method.

## How to Use

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Convert the pseudocode into the programming language of your choice.
3. Use your own dataset or the datasets provided by the author.
4. Run the Python (or other programming language) code blocks.
5. The code includes detailed comments and spreadsheets to help you understand its functionality.
